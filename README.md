📌 Project Summary

This project presents a PESTEL analysis of Wipro Ltd.’s workforce using real employee data (1,452 records) to identify operational risks and opportunities in supply chain and human resource management.

🔍 Key Methods

Descriptive statistics → Workforce demographics, salary, tenure, absenteeism, overtime.

Correlation analysis → Weak but notable links between absenteeism, performance, and promotions.

Logistic regression → Tested predictors of resignation (e.g., layoffs, overtime, training, performance).

K-Means clustering → Segmented employees into risk groups based on tenure and salary.

AI techniques (PCA + clustering) → Identified exit-risk clusters and attrition patterns.

📊 Main Findings

High attrition risk (50.7%) tied to layoffs and excessive overtime.

Economic & legal factors (salary, job security, compliance) most critical risks.

Social & technological factors shape workforce diversity, training, and digital readiness.

Environmental factors (commute distance, workload) influence absenteeism and well-being.

✅ Recommendations

Reduce overtime & layoff impacts with workload balance and support programs.

Expand structured training & upskilling for long-term engagement.

Use segmented HR strategies (e.g., onboarding for new hires, leadership paths for seniors).

Promote flexible work & wellness programs to address burnout.

Enhance predictive modeling with employee satisfaction/behavioral data.

🎯 Impact

The analysis provides Wipro with a data-driven HR framework to manage risks, improve retention, and align workforce strategies with external PESTEL factors. The methodology can be adapted for other IT service companies facing similar challenges.
